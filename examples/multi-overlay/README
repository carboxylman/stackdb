In this example, we first run a client-server pair to play pingpong,
then we monitor their pingpng valuable. 

The c_pingpong reprensents client pingpong.
The s_pingpong reprensents server pingpong. 

Each of the client and server does the same thing: 
	receive a value, 
	add one to the value, 	
	send the added value back. 

Compile it:
	make -f Makefile.example
Run it:
	1. In the first terminal: 
      $ ./server
    2. In the second terminal: 
	  $ ./client
    3. In the third terminal: 
	  $ sudo ./multi-overlay vm3 server:84:s_pingpong client:49:c_pingpong

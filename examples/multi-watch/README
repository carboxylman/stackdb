In this example, we first run a client-server pair to play pingpong,
then we monitor their pingpng valuable. 

The c_pingpong reprensents client pingpong.
The s_pingpong reprensents server pingpong. 

Each of the client and server does the same thing: 
	receive a value, 
	add one to the value, 	
	send the added value back. 

Compile it:
	make -f Makefile.example
Run it:
	1. In the first terminal: 
      $ ./server 
      then you will get a port number.
    2. In the second terminal: 
	  $ ./client 127.0.0.1 <port number>
    3. In the third terminal: 
	  $ sudo ./multi-watch `pgrep -n server`:s_pingpong `pgrep -n client`:c_pingpong

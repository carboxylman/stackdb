read_string() still seems to have a problem when it sometimes returns an empty string (""). 

wrap vmprobes with helper functions. helper functions include

2) some functions to control domains

write SWIG-related code to catch exceptions in python callback handlers.

complete parse_probepoint().
- make it support both domain name and id.

save memory by using another abstraction "vmtap_domain".

write a python disktop using vmtap.

implement "debuginfo explorer" and integrate it with vmtap.

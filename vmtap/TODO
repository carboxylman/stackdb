read_string() still seems to have a problem when it sometimes returns an empty string (""). 

read_string() allocates memory for the string to return but there is no good way to free the memory later - fix this to avoid memory leaks.

wrap vmprobes with helper functions. helper functions include
1) some functions to get domain info
2) some functions to control domains

write SWIG-related code to catch exceptions in python callback handlers.

save memory by using another abstraction "vmtap_domain".

write a python disktop using vmtap.

implement "debuginfo explorer" and integrate it with vmtap.

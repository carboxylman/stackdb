Sharing debuginfo amongst multiple processes:


  * (Actually, one shortcut to sharing is to lockdown shared debugfiles
    -- i.e., to have two modes of sharing.  The first is SHARE_FORK, in
    which the debugfile must be fully loaded prior to sharing, and then
    refcnt usage must be disabled by all users -- thus the pages will
    (mostly) stay shared by the processes (given a CoW fork
    implementation), especially for large debugfiles.  The second mode
    would be SHARE_MMAP, which is described below.)


  * We need a library interface in dwdebug that facilitates sharing
    debugfile data.  This interface will use some slab/other allocator that we
    can target to a specific mmap range.

  * When loading a debugfile, a user can choose to say if it is
    "publicly" accessible (read-only); if so, the slab malloc in mmap'd
    region will be used.

  * There needs to be a system-wide dir of known mmap regions (a
    registry) so that processes can use them on the cheap by mapping
    them directly into place so pointers still work.  Need to make sure
    to tightly control address space layout by the linker to make this
    work (but what about stack, heap?)... we'll have to disable ASLR.

  * Then, any process could open and load in one or more debuginfo
    files, register with the registry, and just sleep() forever.

  * Debugfiles that will be shared must be fully loaded.  We are not
    going to mess with partial loading support because it will require
    growing a shared region -- dicey when we need to make sure we can 

  * Also, we will not do refcnts within shared debugfiles -- the mmaps
    are read-only, so we can't.  We will rely on a single "refcnt" --
    the fact that the process has mmap'd the debugfile; the server will
    know this and not change anything about the debugfile.

  * CRAP: the glib, judy, and libelf data.  Maybe we'd better just
    figure a way to shm_open and mmap the heap of each process, and
    figure out how to control where the heap is created.

    * ok, with glib we have a way, as long as we have a malloc()
      interface -- g_mem_set_vtable()!  But this is global to all glib
      data allocated in a single process.  So as long as none of the
      other libs we link with use glib, we should be ok.

    * Judy we might have to hack to use a different malloc() --
      actually, if we change the JudyCommon/JudyMalloc.c interface,
      we're good.  However, this is also per-process-global, like glib.

    * we should not care about sharing any libelf/elfutils data!  strip
      it out if we currently do.

    * THUS... we don't even have to share the heap, as long as we can
      target glib and judy to a shared mem region.

  * SO, conclusion from above: a single process could load multiple
    debugfiles to share, but all file data will be in one mmap segment
    -- which means any "clients" would get *all* debugfiles allocated in
    that "server" process if they wanted any one of them!

    * Probably the best way to deal with this is for the interface to
      loading a shared debugfile do a possible fork before loading: the
      new process would load, register the debugfile with the registry,
      have the registry map it via shm_open and mmap, then exit (leaving
      the shm-created segment in place until it is munmap'd by the
      registry).

    * Actually, a better way would be to ask the registry to load the
      debugfile.  The registry could fork (thus changing malloc impls if
      needed, as discussed above), pick a new addr to load the debugfile
      at, load it, and share the new segment with the registry.

      * This would definitely work fine if the registry itself does not
        use glib; otherwise we would have to see if g_mem_set_vtable
        works after a fork, before an exec.

  * We can use MM, or any of the slab allocators that present us a
    malloc interface that we can target at a specific address (that
    holds for MM too).

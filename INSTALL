Installing StackDB
==================

Currently, you must install StackDB from source.  StackDB is available
via git at http://git-public.flux.utah.edu/git/a3/vmi.git .  StackDB is
only available for Linux, and for `x86/x86_64` architectures.  StackDB
itself will likely build on non-Linux UNIX-like OSes; but first, because
it depends on elfutils; and second, because we have only been interested
in applying it to platforms that are best-supported under Linux (such as
Xen and QEMU/KVM), we do not support other build environments.

Dependencies
------------

To build StackDB, your system must have the following packages installed:

  * [glib] >= 2.29;
  * [elfutils] (>= 0.137 should be fine, but ideally you will want
    something much newer, such as 0.152; also note that if you use this
    library on a DWARF version 4-encoded file, and build against
    elfutils <= 0.141, many things will probably break);
  * [Judy] (used for fast data indexing);
  * [distorm] (necessary for x86/x86_64 disassembly, CFI checking, ROP
    detection).

On any modern, recently-updated Linux distribution, these packages may
be available in the distribution's repositories (with the exception of
distorm).  You shouldn't need to build them from source, but we provide
instructions below if you feel the need to do so.

### Optional Packages ###

StackDB's functionality can be enhanced by installing the following
packages and enabling them when building StackDB.

  * [Xen] (if you want StackDB to attach to to Xen VMs, you'll need the
    Xen binaries, *and* the libxc development headers/libs);
  * [Qemu] (if you want StackDB to attach to QEMU/KVM VMs, you'll need
    the qemu binaries -- none of the development headers nor libs
    though).
  * [libvmi] (StackDB provides essentially the same memory access
    functionality for Xen and KVM that libvmi does; but you can choose
    to use StackDB's built-in support, or optionally libvmi if you
    install it and configure StackDB to use it at build time);
  * [gsoap] ==2.8.11 (for SOAP XML service support; also necessary for
    SOAP clients; must apply StackDB patches and build it manually!);
  * python-suds and pysimplesoap (for SOAP XML python clients; must
    apply our patch to pysimplesoap);
  * a Java SDK >= 1.6, Apache Ant, and Apache Axis2 (for SOAP XML java
    clients)

In the following two sections, we provide instructions for building
dependencies, followed by instructions for building this package.

Notes on Building Dependencies
------------------------------
  * glib

    Grab http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/glib/2.30/glib-2.30.2.tar.bz2;
    unpack; and configure like this:

        ./configure --prefix=/opt/vmi/glib

    We suggest you put glib in /opt to prevent other system binaries
    from being linked with it.  This could happen if you install it to
    /usr/local, since your LD configuration might include
    /usr/local/lib.  This would be bad, so use /opt, unless you know
    what you're doing.

    Then make and make install like normal:

        make && make install

  * elfutils

    Grab https://fedorahosted.org/releases/e/l/elfutils/0.152/elfutils-0.152.tar.bz2;
    unpack; and configure like this (but see note below first!):

        ./configure --prefix=/opt/vmi/elfutils --with-zlib --with-bzlib \
            --enable-debugpred

    (you can also add the `--program-prefix=vmi-eu-` argument so that you
    don't have confusion between `readelf` and other binaries from the
    system elfutils... but this should not happen if you install to
    /opt/vmi/elfutils, since /opt/vmi/elfutils/usr/bin is probably not going
    to be in your PATH!).

    *Note*: if you are building on an ancient Linux (i.e., Fedora 8), you may
    need some additional patches when building elfutils.  If you are
    building on Emulab, you can find these at

    - https://fedorahosted.org/releases/e/l/elfutils/0.152/elfutils-portability.patch
    - https://fedorahosted.org/releases/e/l/elfutils/0.152/elfutils-robustify.patch

    Just apply them in this order and install normally:

        patch -p1 < elfutils-portability.patch
        patch -p1 < elfutils-robustify.patch
        ./configure && make && make install

  * distorm

    Download `distorm` from
    http://code.google.com/p/distorm/downloads .  Unpack it and build
    like this:

        cd distorm/make/linux && make && make install

    (edit distorm/make/linux/Makefile if you want to install it
    somewhere other than /usr/local)

    `distorm` does not install its headers correctly; so manually
    install them:

        cd ../.. && cp -pv distorm/include/* /usr/local/include

    (or wherever you changed the Makefile to install to, if not /usr/local)

  * Judy

    Grab http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/judy/judy/Judy-1.0.5/Judy-1.0.5.tar.gz .
    Unpack, configure, make, make install.  If you change the build
    prefix to anything other than /usr or /usr/local, you'll need to
    tell StackDB via its ./configure script later on via
    `--with-judy=/my/prefix`.

  * gsoap

    Grab gsoap_2.8.11.zip from http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soap.html .
    Unpack it.  Then apply the `gsoap-2.8.11-noserve.patch` and
    `gsoap-2.8.11-xs-include-to-module.patch` in the StackDB source code
    directory (`vmi/xml/etc`).

    	patch -p1 < ../../vmi/xml/etc/gsoap-2.8.11-noserve.patch
    	patch -p1 < ../../vmi/xml/etc/gsoap-2.8.11-xs-include-to-module.patch

    Then configure, make, install.  If you change the build prefix to
    anything other than /usr, you'll need to tell StackDB via its
    ./configure script later on via `--with-gsoap=/my/prefix`.

        ./configure && make && make install

  * python-suds

    Grab python-suds-0.4.tar.gz from https://fedorahosted.org/suds/ , or
    install it via your distro's packaging system.  If installing from
    source, install *using Python 2.x, not 3.x*, via the standard dance
    of

        cd python-suds-0.4 && python2 setup.py build && python2 setup.py install

  * pysimplesoap

    Grab the latest pysimplesoap from http://code.google.com/p/pysimplesoap/ .
    Unpack it, then apply the pysimplesoap-soap-env.patch in the StackDB
    source code (`vmi/xml/etc/pysimplesoap-soap-env.patch`).

        patch -p1 < ../../vmi/xml/etc/pysimplesoap-soap-env.patch

    Then install *using Python 2.x, not 3.x*, via the standard dance of

        cd pysimplesoap && python2 setup.py build && python2 setup.py install

  * Apache Ant and Axis2:

    Grab apache-ant-1.8.4-bin.zip from http://ant.apache.org/, and grab
    axis2-1.6.2-bin.zip from http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/ .
    Unpack them and place them anywhere (/usr/local or /opt are checked by
    the StackDB configure script, or tell StackDB where they are via the
    `--with-ant` and `--with-axis2` ./configure options).  If there is
    no `javac` in your $PATH, you'll also have to tell StackDB's
    ./configure script where your Java SDK is installed via `--with-java`.


Building and Installing StackDB
-------------------------------

StackDB is easy to install.  Enter the source directory you cloned or
downloaded, and run autoconf:

    cd vmi && autoconf && cd ..

Create a separate build directory:

    mkdir vmi.obj && cd vmi.obj

Then run StackDB's `configure` script with the options you need, based
on the instructions above (or run `../vmi/configure --help` to make sure
you've got the build options you want):

    ../vmi/configure --prefix=/usr/local

(or maybe something like this, if your glib, distorm, and elfutils are
installed in non-standard places:)

    ../vmi/configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-glib=/opt/vmi/glib \
        --with-elfutils=/opt/vmi/elfutils

Finally, build and install StackDB:

    make && make install

After installing, please refer to the [Quick Start] or [User Guide]
documentation.  (These documents may also be found in the source
directory in `vmi/doc{quick-start.md,user-guide.md}`.
